All you have to do is install node.js from https://nodejs.org/en, run command promp/terminal in the parent directory, run "npm install", let it install the dependencies, then run "npm start" and ctrl+left click the url that gets listed in it or copy and paste it into a browser (hopefully).
this is my first time using github so don't dog on me too hard.
